Building Online Apps with R - the 2018 version of the Course - EXAMPLE CODE

## Organization

The source code in this course is organized in a folder structure that allows to easily build an R package later on. 

- document root: project folder: use this for experiments, run scripts etc. 
- R: R code in functions, typically one function per file, several helpers can be organized in one file
- inst/app : Folder where the apps live (basically every app has an own folder with a ui.R and server.R file per app)
- man: Automatically generated user manual. Not edited manually, generated by roxygen2.
- DESCRIPTION file (optional, only needed for packages): contains important build information for packages
- NAMESPACE file (optional, only needed for packages): Not edited manually, generated by roxygen2. Controls which functions and classes are exposed to the user of the package
